I used C to represent the events inside an array of data structures. I used data structures because they can contain variable of different data types which allowed to include variables such as the event name, month, day, year, start time and end time. I split the dates up into years, months, and days so that they would be easier to compare between events.
The algorithm works by using 2 for loops. The outside for loop is used to represent the event currently being compared. The inner for loop compares the current event with each other event in the array. It does this by checking if the event's year matches another event's year, then their months and days. After that, it checks if the event's start time and end time fall within any of the other events' start and end times.
If any of the times fall within the start or end of another event, a conflict has been found and it will print the names of the events that are conflicting.
